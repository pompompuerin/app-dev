# ⭐ My Favorite Series! ⭐
## One of my all time favorite animated series is **Steven Universe** by Rebecca Sugar

---

## Description
### It follows Steven, a kindhearted boy who is half-human, half-Gem — magical, gem-powered aliens who protect Earth. Alongside the *Crystal Gems* — Garnet, Amethyst, and Pearl — Steven learns to use his powers, uncover his mother’s mysterious past, and fight to bring peace between humans and Gems.

## Characters 💗
### The characters in this series have diverse personalities, each with their own charm ^^
1. Steven Universe - A cheerful, compassionate boy who is half-human, half-Gem. He inherits his powers from his mother, Rose Quartz.
2. Garnet - The calm, strong leader of the Crystal Gems, secretly a fusion of two Gems, Ruby and Sapphire.
3. Amethyst - A fun-loving, somewhat messy Gem who struggles with self-acceptance.
4. Pearl - A graceful, perfectionist Gem deeply devoted to Rose Quartz.
5. Rose Quartz - Steven’s mother and former leader of the Crystal Gems, who gave up her physical form to create Steven.
6. Connie Maheswaran - Steven’s best friend (and later romantic partner), a human who trains in sword fighting.

*and many more!*

## Songs I loved from the series 🎵
### Another thing I love about Steven Universe is the collection of songs throughout the series. Here are some of my favorites!
